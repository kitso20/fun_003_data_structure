# Problems - Stats WTC

* Modify `data_structures.py` to solve the problem as stated in doc strings.
* You can test technical correctness by running the unittests as in the section *To Test* below.

### To Test

* To run all the unittests: `python3 -m unittest tests/test_data_structures.py`
* To run a specific step's unittest, e.g step *1*: `python3 -m unittest tests.test_data_structures.TestFunctions.test_find_max`
* _Note_: at the minimum, these (*unedited*) tests must succeed before you may submit the solution for review.
